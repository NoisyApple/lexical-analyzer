# Lexical Analyzer

## How to run

Execute with maven:

```sh
mvn package && clear && java -cp target/lexical-syntactical-analyzer-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.noisyapple.App ./inputFile3.txt ./inputGrammar1.txt
```

The example above will run the tool with `inputFile3.txt` and `inputGrammar1.txt`, you could change that to a different file as far as the grammar and source code are compatible, if not an error may occur.
